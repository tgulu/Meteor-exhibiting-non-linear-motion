A computer vision programme that examines a series of images and detects any alien blob moving non-linearly among a group of meteors travelling in a straight line. The set images are made up of 50 frames captured by both the left and right cameras at the same time.

The test frames were taken from cameras located 3.5 kilometres apart, with their optical axes perfectly aligned and a focal length of 12 metres. The cameras have a pixel spacing of 10 microns.
